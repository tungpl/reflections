How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    --It highlighted the differences between to version and make it easier to figure out the bug.	

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

-- During the develoment life cycle, there is multiple changes in files, so keep track of history is very very important.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
--Git : better descript for the update, change however it take more effort
  Google save: eveything goes under background but it is lacking of description
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

--Because google docs just care about changing content of a doucument once at a time. But with git, you can control the whole project.			

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-- git log to see the entire history of project and diff we can compare the change between commits.
    

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

--Definitely since it allow you to revert to whatever stage you did.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

-- I want to practice more.
